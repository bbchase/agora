    - You should be familiar with the following terms/concepts:OSI modelThe Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model defines seven
          different layers of technology: physical, data link, network,
          transport, session, presentation, and application. This model allows
          network engineers and network vendors to easily discuss and apply
          technology to a specific OSI level. This segmentation lets engineers
          divide the overall problem of getting one application to talk to
          another into discrete parts and more manageable sections. Each level
          has certain attributes that describe it and each level interacts
          with its neighboring levels in a very well-defined manner. Knowledge
