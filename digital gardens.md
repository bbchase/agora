    - I think these ideas all make sense to me, but I need to think about how to actually use them. I can collect interesting articles or go off on tangents about intellectually interesting ideas, but in order to make this a useful tool and not just a toy, I think I need to fill it with things that I actually use. That probably means a lot of [[networking]] knowledge right now. 
    - It is interesting though, that being in this space has piqued my interest in other areas of knowledge. I don’t know if that’s just seeing a trend, nostalgia for previous musings, or a real interest. 
    - Another way to think about this: Where could I add meaningful thoughts to the public sphere. Where might I have a hope of contributing?

        - with clear writing, you usually don't need complex navigation unless  the subject matter ' especially complex
        - Ridgid structure is costly and pulls attention away from the message. You want traffic to center around  the best pages, not navigation

            - essay: https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/
            - " we have been swept away by streams"
            - "streams are fleeting. They surface the Zetigeisty thoughts of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time.”
            - Articles present an opinion. Gardens- collections of connected ideas - don't know what they think yet
