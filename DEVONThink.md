- Thoughts on replacing Evernote
    - Handles many different types of text files
        - plain text
        - markdown
        - rich text
        - HTML
        - Formatted note (not sure what this is)
        - Sheet (not sure what this is
    - Markdown editing modes: source, preview, split-pane
    - Web clipper seems pretty versatile - lets you clip markdown versions.

        - Saving plain text and markup versions is pretty awesome
        - Clutter-free is also pretty great
        - Comments could let me pre-make links and tags
    - It feels a bit clunky. The interface is very busy and I often feel like I can't find the thing I'm looking for
    - I'm not sure how well OCR works. Seems to be great for PDFs, but I'm not sure about finding text in images. Maybe I just need to fiddle.
