    - The longer I procrastinate on returning phone calls and emails, the more guilty I feel about it. The guilt I feel causes me to avoid the issue further, which only leads to more guilt and more procrastination. It gets to the point where I don’t email someone for fear of reminding them that they emailed me and thus giving them a reason to be disappointed in me.

    - If something I don’t like happens, then several more things that I don’t like happen directly afterward, that is too many. They shouldn’t cluster like that. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSB2AE4&location=1211))
