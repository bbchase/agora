    - We need to set up accounts at solid banks, automate our day-to-day money management (including bills, savings, and, if applicable, debt payoff).

    - Cynics don’t want results; they want an excuse to not take action. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GNXPP4P&location=380))
    - It’s easy for people in their twenties to wish that their colleges had offered some personal finance training. Guess what? Most colleges do offer those classes. You just didn’t take them! ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GNXPP4P&location=392))
    - Do you need to be the Iron Chef to cook a grilled-cheese sandwich? No, ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GNXPP4P&location=413))
    - Getting started is more important than becoming an expert. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GNXPP4P&location=435))
    - I’d rather act and get it 85 percent right than do nothing. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GNXPP4P&location=437))
    - It’s okay to make mistakes. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GNXPP4P&location=440))
