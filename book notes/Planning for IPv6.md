    - your CEO may suddenly ask for a new and cool ecommerce application, or a new collaboration tool that happens to use IPv6 features — and he’ll probably want it implemented in three months. 
    - Back in the early 1980s, studies were conducted to determine the likelihood that in the future there would be a computer on every desk of an organization. The results showed that this was very unlikely. 
    - Integrating IPv6 under time pressure creates many disadvantages. High costs and unnecessary risks are the consequences. You lose the opportunity to learn as you go, to carefully plan, evaluate and test. By integrating IPv6 you lay the foundation for your next generation network. Take your time to do it carefully. By delaying the adoption of IPv6 for too long, you are putting your company’s competitiveness at risk. 
    - The business case for IPv6 is the continued use and expansion of the Internet.

    - In the early 1990s, studies showed that it was highly unlikely that everyone would soon have a cell phone. 
    - don’t wait until your customers ask for IPv6, because they probably never will. They will ask for services, and those services might just happen to require an IPv6 infrastructure. 
    - we can say that IPv6 is part of evolving our infrastructure, evolving the network that transports all data — it is the future highway for our data. So asking for a business case for IPv6 is like asking for the business case of running a network. 
    - while you work on deployment in the core, your critical user or customer traffic still flows over the IPv4 infrastructure, so you can deploy IPv6 with no risk or pressure. You can also implement management and security, and then test everything carefully before you allow user and customer traffic. This approach helps you train your people, get experience in managing the new infrastructure, and build your support teams, such as help desk and second-level support. 
    - Prudent investments in networking and other infrastructure are not just an expense — they often result in improved capabilities and a foundation for future innovation 
    - In many cases, integrating IPv6 for public-facing services is the first step, and it is also considered a good approach because it is one of the easier parts of integration. Starting where it is easier allows you to use that part of the project to gather experience and better prepares you to tackle the internal network with its higher complexity. 
    - You may separate your planning into the following areas:
Core/Backbone
User/Customer networks
Data center
DMZ/Internet (customer facing) 
    - the 2009 update to the procurement requirements of the United States Federal Acquisition Regulation, which stipulates that “Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) compliant products be included in all new information technology (IT) acquisitions using Internet Protocol (IP).” 
    - we know that if we don’t upgrade to a current version, the devices or operating systems will perform poorly or fail at some point, or we won’t be able to run new services on top of them.
