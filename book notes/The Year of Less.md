    - I had opted not to learn any of the same skills my parents had, knowing I could pay—and cheap prices, at that—for everything instead.

    - Your values should not be your aspirations—confusing the two is just one of the reasons I used to buy things for the ideal version of myself. ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0767XNB47&location=2166))
