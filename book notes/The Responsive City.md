First, there is a narrow and technical definition of what constitutes good work by government employees; second, the vertical silos of the usual city government's organization block the free flows of ideas and information, making it ill suited to problems that don't fit into the “verticals”; and, third, the bureaucracy orients itself to performing and measuring activities (potholes filled, cases processed) rather than solutions to problems.

    - it requires five characteristics: well-visualized data, savvy intermediaries, a governmental platform that works, personalized responses from city hall, and resulting real-time information. ([Location 1412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MQTIA3M&location=1412))
