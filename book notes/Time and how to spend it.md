the Hero's Journey
The idea is to interpret your life in terms of the
hero's journey. What events or feelings might be a
call to adventure? Who are your allies and enemies? What are trials for you to overcome? Lessons to learn? thresholds to cross?

Instead of getting annoyed at challenges, or at people at work, how can you interpret them as trials to overcome and grow from? In any situation, ask yourself, "What is the lesson I'm supposed to learn from this?

Maybe this would be a helpful view for me to adopt for
two reasons:
	1. It could help me fight the tendency to see myself as an observer in my own life.
	2. It could help me remain emotionally distant from challenges or from people who aren't acting the way I think they should.
