    - The most boring and unproductive question one can ask of any religion is whether or not it is true ([Location 37](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005IEGU5C&location=37))
    - In a world beset by fundamentalists of both believing and secular varieties, it must be possible to balance a rejection of religious faith with a selective reverence for religious rituals and concepts. ([Location 51](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005IEGU5C&location=51))
    - God may be dead, but the urgent issues which impelled us to make him up still stir and demand resolutions which do not go away ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005IEGU5C&location=57))
    - Secular society has been unfairly impoverished by the loss of an array of practices and themes which atheists typically find it impossible to live with because they seem too closely associated with, to quote Nietzsche’s useful phrase, ‘the bad odours of religion’. We have grown frightened of the word morality. We bridle at the thought of hearing a sermon. We flee from the idea that art should be uplifting or have an ethical mission. We don’t go on pilgrimages. We can’t build temples. We have no mechanisms for expressing gratitude. The notion of reading a self-help book has become absurd to the high-minded. We resist mental exercises. Strangers rarely sing together. We are presented with an unpleasant choice between either committing to peculiar concepts about immaterial deities or letting go entirely of a host of consoling, subtle or just charming rituals for which we struggle to find equivalents in secular society.

    - To this the answer is that religions merit our attention for their sheer conceptual ambition; for changing the world in a way that few secular institutions ever have. They have managed to combine theories about ethics and metaphysics with a practical involvement in education, fashion, politics, travel, hostelry, initiation ceremonies, publishing, art and architecture ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005IEGU5C&location=115))
    - Locked away in our private cocoons, our chief way of imagining what other people are like has become the media, ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005IEGU5C&location=168))
    - Solitary though we may have become, we haven’t of course given up all hope of forming relationships. In the lonely canyons of the modern city, there is no more honoured emotion than love. However, this is not the love of which religions speak, not the expansive, universal brotherhood of mankind; it is a more jealous, restricted and ultimately meaner variety. It is a romantic love which sends us on a maniacal quest for a single person with whom we hope to achieve a life-long and complete communion, one person in particular who will spare us any need for people in general.
