    - Like the famous question about the chicken and the egg, the answer is less important than the cycle it describes. Racist ideas make people of color think less of themselves, which makes them more vulnerable to racist ideas. Racist ideas make White people think more of themselves, which further attracts them to racist ideas. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=96))
    - “Racist” is not—as Richard Spencer argues—a pejorative. It is not the worst word in the English language; it is not the equivalent of a slur. It is descriptive, and the only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it—and then dismantle it. The attempt to turn this usefully descriptive term into an almost unusable slur is, of course, designed to do the opposite: to freeze us into inaction. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=157))
    - THE COMMON IDEA of claiming “color blindness” is akin to the notion of being “not racist”—as with the “not racist,” the color-blind individual, by ostensibly failing to see race, fails to see racism and falls into racist passivity. The language of color blindness—like the language of “not racist”—is a mask to hide racism. ([Location 161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=161))
    - I used to be racist most of the time. I am changing. I am no longer identifying with racists by claiming to be “not racist.” I am no longer speaking through the mask of racial neutrality. I am no longer manipulated by racist ideas to see racial groups as problems. I no longer believe a Black person cannot be racist. I am no longer policing my every action around an imagined White or Black judge, trying to convince White people of my equal humanity, trying to convince Black people I am representing the race well. I no longer care about how the actions of other Black individuals reflect on me, since none of us are race representatives, nor is any individual responsible for someone else’s racist ideas. And I’ve come to see that the movement from racist to antiracist is always ongoing—it requires understanding and snubbing racism based on biology, ethnicity, body, culture, behavior, color, space, and class. And beyond that, it means standing ready to fight at racism’s intersections with other bigotries. ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=170))
    - RACIST: One who is supporting a racist policy through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea. ANTIRACIST: One who is supporting an antiracist policy through their actions or expressing an antiracist idea. ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=190))
    - Skinner shared how he came to worship an elite White Jesus Christ, who cleaned people up through “rules and regulations,” a savior who prefigured Richard Nixon’s vision of law and order. But one day, Skinner realized that he’d gotten Jesus wrong. Jesus wasn’t in the Rotary Club and he wasn’t a policeman. Jesus was a “radical revolutionary, with hair on his chest and dirt under his fingernails.” ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=225))
    - “Any gospel that does not…speak to the issue of enslavement” and “injustice” and “inequality—any gospel that does not want to go where people are hungry and poverty-stricken and set them free in the name of Jesus Christ—is not the gospel.” ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=229))
    - the key act for both of us was defining our terms so that we could begin to describe the world and our place in it. Definitions anchor us in principles. This is not a light point: If we don’t do the basic work of defining the kind of people we want to be in language that is stable and consistent, we can’t work toward stable, consistent goals. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=261))
    - What is racism? Racism is a marriage of racist policies and racist ideas that produces and normalizes racial inequities. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=266))
    - Racial inequity is when two or more racial groups are not standing on approximately equal footing. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=270))
    - A racist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups. An antiracist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups. By policy, I mean written and unwritten laws, rules, procedures, processes, regulations, and guidelines that govern people. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=274))
    - As President Lyndon B. Johnson said in 1965, “You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, ‘You are free to compete with all the others,’ and still justly believe that you have been completely fair.” ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=295))
    - The most threatening racist movement is not the alt right’s unlikely drive for a White ethnostate but the regular American’s drive for a “race-neutral” one. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=300))
    - The construct of race neutrality actually feeds White nationalist victimhood by positing the notion that any policy protecting or advancing non-White Americans toward equity is “reverse discrimination.” ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=301))
    - A racist idea is any idea that suggests one racial group is inferior or superior to another racial group in any way. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=307))
    - An antiracist idea is any idea that suggests the racial groups are equals in all their apparent differences—that there is nothing right or wrong with any racial group. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=310))
    - Racism is a powerful collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity and are substantiated by racist ideas. Antiracism is a powerful collection of antiracist policies that lead to racial equity and are substantiated by antiracist ideas. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=313))
    - Do-nothing climate policy is racist policy, since the predominantly non-White global south is being victimized by climate change more than the Whiter global north, even as the Whiter global north is contributing more to its acceleration. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=320))
    - nearly four thousand U.S. areas—mostly poor and non-White—have higher lead poisoning rates than Flint, Michigan. ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=324))
    - Wisconsin’s strict voter-ID law suppressed approximately two hundred thousand votes—again primarily targeting voters of color—in the 2016 election. Donald Trump won that critical swing state by 22,748 votes. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=345))
    - What side of history will we stand on? A racist is someone who is supporting a racist policy by their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea. An antiracist is someone who is supporting an antiracist policy by their actions or expressing an antiracist idea. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=347))
    - “Racist” and “antiracist” are like peelable name tags that are placed and replaced based on what someone is doing or not doing, supporting or expressing in each moment. These are not permanent tattoos. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=349))
    - The stiffer sentencing policies for drug crimes—not a net increase in crime—caused the American prison population to quadruple between 1980 and 2000. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=378))
    - White people are more likely than Black and Latinx people to sell drugs, and the races consume drugs at similar rates. Yet African Americans are far more likely than Whites to be jailed for drug offenses. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=381))
    - President Richard Nixon announced his war on drugs in 1971 to devastate his harshest critics—Black and antiwar activists. “We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news,” Nixon’s domestic-policy chief, John Ehrlichman, told a Harper’s reporter years later. “Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.” ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=389))
    - This dueling consciousness nourished Black pride by insisting that there was nothing wrong with Black people, but it also cultivated shame with its implication that there was something behaviorally wrong with Black people…well, at least those other Black people. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=473))
    - This cause and effect—a racist power creates racist policies out of raw self-interest; the racist policies necessitate racist ideas to justify them—lingers over the life of racism. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=645))
    - FROM THE JUNIOR Black Americans of Achievement series onward, I had been taught that racist ideas cause racist policies. That ignorance and hate cause racist ideas. That the root problem of racism is ignorance and hate. But that gets the chain of events exactly wrong. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=647))
    - Scholars call what I saw a “microaggression,” a term coined by eminent Harvard psychiatrist Chester Pierce in 1970. Pierce employed the term to describe the constant verbal and nonverbal abuse racist White people unleash on Black people wherever we go, day after day. A White woman grabs her purse when a Black person sits next to her. The seat next to a Black person stays empty on a crowded bus. A White woman calls the cops at the sight of Black people barbecuing in the park. White people telling us that our firmness is anger or that our practiced talents are natural. Mistaking us for the only other Black person around. Calling the cops on our children for selling lemonade on the street. Butchering Ebonics for sport. Assuming we are the help. Assuming the help isn’t brilliant. Asking us questions about the entire Black race. Not giving us the benefit of the doubt. Calling the cops on us for running down the street. ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=692))
    - I do not use “microaggression” anymore. I detest the post-racial platform that supported its sudden popularity. I detest its component parts—“micro” and “aggression.” A persistent daily low hum of racist abuse is not minor. I use the term “abuse” because aggression is not as exacting a term. Abuse accurately describes the action and its effects on people: distress, anger, worry, [[depression]], anxiety, pain, fatigue, and suicide. What other people call racial microaggressions I call racist abuse. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=711))
    - When geneticists compare these ethnic populations, they find there is more genetic diversity between populations within Africa than between Africa and the rest of the world. Ethnic groups in Western Africa are more genetically similar to ethnic groups in Western Europe than to ethnic groups in Eastern Africa. Race is a genetic mirage. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=820))
    - A study that used National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data from 1976 to 1989 found that young Black males engaged in more violent crime than young White males. But when the researchers compared only employed young males of both races, the differences in violent behavior vanished. ([Location 1229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=1229))
    - The act of making a cultural standard and hierarchy is what creates cultural racism. ([Location 1303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=1303))
    - Individual behaviors can shape the success of individuals. But policies determine the success of groups. And it is racist power that creates the policies that cause racial inequities. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=1464))
    - racism infects our perception of the world. In other words, when we believe that a racial group’s seeming success or failure redounds to each of its individual members, we’ve accepted a racist idea. ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=1467))
    - Likewise, when we believe that an individual’s seeming success or failure redounds to an entire group, we’ve accepted a racist idea. ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=1468))
    - Whenever we say something just feels right or wrong we’re evading the deeper, perhaps hidden, ideas that inform our feelings. ([Location 1666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=1666))
