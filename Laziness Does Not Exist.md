    - There are always barriers. Recognizing those barriers— and viewing them as legitimate — is often the first step to breaking “lazy” behavior patterns. 
    - It’s really helpful to respond to a person’s ineffective behavior with curiosity rather than judgment 
    - If a person’s behavior doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you are missing a part of their context 
    - For decades, psychological research has been able to explain procrastination as a functioning problem, not a consequence of laziness. When a person fails to begin a project that they care about, it’s typically due to either a) anxiety about their attempts not being “good enough” or b) confusion about what the first steps of the task are. Not laziness. In fact, procrastination is more likely when the task is meaningful and the individual cares about doing it well.
