- Been trying out some coffee alternatives lately.
- Goals for coffee alternatives
    - reduce [[caffeine]] intake
    - reduce acidity
    - reduce fissure issue
    - reduce irritability
    - reduce blood sugar drops around 11am
    - reduce post-coffee fatigue
    - sleep better at night
    - Be able to have as many tasy warm drinks as I want, whenever I want
- Coffee Alternatives:
    - Teeccino [[purchased]] [[caffeine-free]]
        - Link:: [Teeccino](https://teeccino.com)

        - Form:: Tea bag or grinds
        - French Roast
            - Doesn’t taste like coffee, but does hit some of the right notes. 
            - It’s a little weak if you’re expecting coffee. Two teabags helps some.
            - Taste:: Robust, dark, chicory, a tiny bit sweet, 
            - I think they’re selling themselves short, or setting themselves up for failure by claiming to taste like coffee. It’s more like a really nice, robust tea
