- Cancel Culture Tropes
	1. Presumption of Guilt
		- “accusation is proof enough” 
        - “believe victims"
    2. Abstraction
        - Replaces the specific, concrete details of a claim with a vague abstraction
            - “Tati accuses James of trying to trick straight men into thinking they’re gay” becomes “James is toxic and manipulative"
                - The main call-out was actually that James endorsed a competing hair vitamin product
            - Accusation becomes fact. Specific action replaced with vague idea. Actions becomes being (tried to becomes “is”).
            - Vague idea possibly has very different connotations. “Sexual preditor” calls to mind very different actions than “tried to trick gay men into thinking they’re gay"
    3. Essentialism
        - Move from criticising actions to criticising the person themselves.
    4. Psudo-moralism or Pseudo-intellectualism
        - People are really interested in the drama and schaudenfreud, not their commitment to moral or intellectual standards.
    5. No Forgiveness 
    6. The Transitive Property of Cancellation 
    7. Dualism
